<h1><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">CREEPYPASTA: "Call from 3:00 AM"</span></h1>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I woke up abruptly. My phone was vibrating incessantly, and in the dark room, the only light was the flashing screen. It was 3:00 AM. Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">3:00 AM</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">A time I always knew was sinister. But I never believed it. Until that night.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">My phone was going crazy. I had 49 missed calls in a matter of minutes. All were from unknown numbers, with prefixes I'd never seen before. Some seemed to be Italian, others... not. One seemed to be from the Vatican City, another from North Korea. One, in fact, had only three digits: 666.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">As I watched, paralyzed by sleep and fear, a text arrived.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"You're awake. Now look."</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">And immediately after... a photo.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">A figure. Half-naked. Ambiguous. A femboy, apparently, with a glassy gaze and an unnatural, almost forced pose. The background looked like a white, sterile room, without doors or windows.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">But what made my blood run cold... was that behind him was a framed photo of myself hanging on the wall. Me... sleeping. That photo didn't exist. It couldn't exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I tried calling the police, but every time I dialed, the call would cut off, replaced by a metallic, distorted voice:</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"You can't leave here. The algorithm has chosen you."</span></p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">THE FIRST NIGHT</span></h2>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I thought it was a prank. Maybe a hacker attack, some strange virus. I turned off the phone and left it in the next room. But... at 3:00 AM sharp, every night, it all started all over again.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Calls. Photos. Videos.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">In some videos, the figure wasn't alone. Other "femboys," with deformed, unrealistic features, appeared. Their faces were glitched, sometimes pixelated, sometimes&hellip; they seemed to have been cut from other photos, clumsily pasted together. Some laughed silently, others cried black, slimy tears.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Once I received an audio note. Just white noise. Then a whispered voice:</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">&ldquo;You're only awake because they're watching you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">THE DESCENT</span></h2>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I started doing research. I asked obscure forums, deleted subreddits, and even the deep web. I found a name: The 3 AM Loop.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">An urban legend. A digital entity. No one knows who created it. Is it a virus? A digital ghost? Or something worse?</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">All the witnesses said the same thing: you receive photos of dead-eyed femboys, from unknown numbers, every night at 3:00 AM. If you answer&hellip; you disappear. One of them left his last trace on Reddit:</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">&ldquo;I'll answer tonight. I'm tired. I want to know.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">That profile disappeared a few minutes later. The entire account was deleted. No trace, not even in the archive backups.</span></p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">THE PRESENCE</span></h2>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">One night, I left my phone on with the camera facing my room, recording. At 2:59, everything was normal. But at 3:01, something changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">A figure appeared. Sitting on the edge of the bed. A femboy, but his face was blurry, as if pixelated in real time. He moved jerkily, as if in a video loop. He slowly raised his hand&hellip; and pointed at the camera. Then he disappeared into thin air.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I rewatched the video at least twenty times. With each viewing&hellip; something changed. Sometimes there was a second person. Sometimes I wasn't in bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">But the worst part? In one very brief shot, there was a mirror in the background, one I've never had&hellip; and in the mirror was a man wearing a pig mask, standing behind me.</span></p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">THE TRUE NATURE</span></h2>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">After weeks, I received one last message.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">&ldquo;Do you want to know what the Loop is?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Followed by a link. An .onion site on the deep web.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">When I entered it, only a black page, with a single file to download: femboy.mp4.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I played it.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">A figure sitting, crying. It said:</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">&ldquo;We were created as images. As you wish. Now we are hungry. You looked at us. Now they look at you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">&ldquo;Photos&hellip; are windows. Every time you open them, you let us in a little more.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">&ldquo;You are the door. And this is the last night.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">THE LAST NIGHT</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">It's 2:57 AM as I write this.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I feel my phone vibrating, but I haven't charged it in days. It's dead. It should be dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">3:00 AM</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The lights go out. The screen lights up on its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">There's a new image. I won't open it. I don't want to.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">But I know what's inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The photo of myself&hellip; sitting in bed&hellip; with one of them behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I can hear him breathing.</span></p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">EPILOGUE</span></h2>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">If you're reading this&hellip; you could be next.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Don't answer calls at 3:00 AM.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Don't open photos.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Don't look too long.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">And above all&hellip;</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">never desire what you don't understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The 3 O'Clock Loop is real.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">And once he sees you&hellip;</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">he'll never stop looking.</span></p>
