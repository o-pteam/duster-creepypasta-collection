<h1><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"Millestendini and the Dolls of the Attic"</span></h1>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Millestendini wasn't his real name. It was a nickname they gave him in middle school, because they said he had a thousand tendons, that he moved like a broken puppet. He hated that name. But it stuck.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">He was nineteen when he moved into the old house of his grandfather, who had died a few months earlier in circumstances that were never fully explained. The house was at the top of a hill, surrounded by trees bent by wind and time. The villagers below said it was cursed, but Millestendini didn't listen to that nonsense.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">He was a solitary, quiet boy, and he loved forgotten places. On his first day, he explored the entire house, but avoided the attic. The trapdoor creaked, as if begging him not to open it. But curiosity, as we know, is stronger than fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">On the night of the third day, he heard a clicking sound coming from above his room. It sounded like small footsteps... or perhaps fingers drumming on wood.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The next day he opened the attic.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Inside, he found only dust, old boxes, cobwebs... and two dolls.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">They were sitting next to each other, on a chipped wooden chair. One had disheveled blond hair, faded blue eyes, and a faded pink dress. The other was larger, with shiny black eyes and an expression that seemed almost... pleased.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Millestendini approached. The dolls were staring at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">He reached for them, but pricked his finger on a rusty pin sticking out of the big doll's dress. A drop of blood fell onto the fabric. At that moment, he swore he saw the doll's mouth move.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">That night, he had a dream. He was in the attic, surrounded by giant dolls who were cutting his tendons one by one, with needle and thread. He felt every tear, but couldn't move, as if he himself had become a puppet.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">He woke up sweating, shaking... and with two red threads tied to his fingers. As if someone had sewn them during the night.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The following days became a nightmare.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Every time he entered the house, he found the dolls in different places: on the couch, at the table, even in bed. And each time, they were closer. The big doll now had a needle stuck in one hand. The little one clutched a ball of red yarn.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">He began to lose feeling in his hands. He felt a tug, as if something was moving his limbs for him. He looked in the mirror and saw thin stitching along his wrists. He didn't remember ever having them.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">One night, he woke to hear a voice whisper:</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"A thousand little hairpins... are you ready to dance for us?"</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The dolls were there. Alive. Their eyes shone. Their bodies moved jerkily, as if animated by an ancient, cruel force. They grabbed him. He felt needles digging into his flesh, threads piercing his muscles.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Then darkness.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The next morning, the house was empty. No one could find any trace of him. Only two dolls, sitting in the attic. One with blond hair. The other with black eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">And between them... a third doll, new.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">With fresh stitching.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">And with the eyes... of Millestendini.</span></p>
