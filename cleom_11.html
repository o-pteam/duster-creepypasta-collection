<span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">It was 2:37 a.m. Her obsession with Genshin Impact was uncontrollable, and that evening she had decided to try one more time to get Raiden Shogun with one last pull.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">&ldquo;Come on, let me out Raiden&hellip;&rdquo; she muttered, clicking the wish button.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The golden screen exploded, her heart pounding, but&hellip; nothing. A four-star weapon.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Frustrated, she sighed and closed the game. She was exhausted. She went to bed, her eyes heavy, and fell asleep immediately.</span></p>
<h2><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The Beginning of the Nightmare&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Mary opened her eyes and found herself in a huge, cold, and deserted supermarket.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The neon lights flickered dimly, casting distorted shadows on the endless shelves.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The air smelled of rust and rotting flesh.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Walking through the aisles, she noticed that the products on the shelves were&hellip; strange. The packages were stained with blood, some containing human bones, others eyeballs staring back at her.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Then, a clap of thunder shattered the silence.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Mary turned and saw her: Raiden Shogun. But she wasn't the same one from the game.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">His face was distorted, his purple eyes glowed with a sickly glow, and his sword pulsed as if alive, dripping black blood.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"Mary..." he whispered in a broken, metallic voice. "It's time to offer yourself to Eternity."</span></p>
<h2><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The Hunt&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Mary began to run through the aisles, breathing heavily, her legs giving way.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">She could hear Raiden's footsteps behind her, the echo of his geta clattering against the floor.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Suddenly, Raiden disappeared. Silence returned.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Mary, trembling, stopped to catch her breath.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Then, a voice hissed behind her ear:</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"Your head... I want your head."</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">She turned, and Raiden was there, his face inches from hers.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The blade came down with a sharp slash. Mary ducked at the last second, feeling the sharp wind brush her hair.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">An entire row of shelves behind her was sliced ​​in half.</span></p>
<h2><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The Ritual&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Mary ran to the frozen food section, her hands shaking, searching for an exit. But there were no doors, only endless walls of cold metal.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">When she turned, she saw that the floor had become a sea of ​​eyes and severed hands that moved on their own, gripping her ankles.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Raiden raised his sword, and blood-soaked Noh masks began to fall from the ceiling.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Mary screamed, but her voice was lost in the echo.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"Offer accepted."</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The blade descended again.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">She felt the cold penetrate her flesh.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">A burning pain.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Then, darkness.</span></p>
<h2><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The Awakening... or Maybe Not&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Mary woke abruptly in her bed, her heart pounding.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">She looked at the clock: 2:37 a.m. Exactly the time she'd stopped playing.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">She thought it was all just a nightmare...</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">But when she picked up her phone, the screen lit up by itself and displayed a single message, signed in pulsing purple letters:</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"Next pull guaranteed... YOUR HEAD."</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Then, footsteps came from the hallway.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Slow footsteps. Heavy.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">And a whisper, getting closer:</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"Mary... it's time."</span></p>
