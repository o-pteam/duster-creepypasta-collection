<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I don't even know why I'm writing this. Maybe to free myself, maybe so someone knows what happened to me, in case there's no tomorrow for me.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">It was a normal night, I was awake with my phone in my hand, like always. Then, at 3:03, it vibrated.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">A notification.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">There was no name, no number. Just a message:</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"I see you."</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I thought it was a bug, spam, or maybe a prank from some weird app. I opened the chat... but there was nothing. The space was empty, as if the message had disappeared.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I tried to go back to sleep, but after a few minutes... another vibration.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Another message.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"I'm at your door."</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I couldn't breathe. I ran to check: the door was locked, everything was fine. But the phone kept vibrating, always with new messages.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"I'm in your room."</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"I'm behind you."</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I couldn't move. I plucked up the courage to take a screenshot, to test it. But the screenshot didn't show the message... only the internal camera, active. And in the reflection, behind my shoulder, a shadow with two white eyes.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I dropped the phone, but it vibrated again. I picked it up, shaking.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Last message:</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"Now it's your turn."</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I haven't been able to sleep since then. I still feel phantom vibrations, but there's nothing on the screen.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">I don't know if I'll be around tomorrow.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">If you get a notification at 3:03 AM too... don't open it.</span></p>
