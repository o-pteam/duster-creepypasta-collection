<h1><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The 3:17 AM Call</span></h1>
<p><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Her name was Tallin. She was a quiet girl, with the habit of leaving her cell phone on all night, on the nightstand, with the ringer on full blast. She said it made her feel safer, "always reachable."</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">One night she woke up suddenly: her phone was ringing. She checked the time: 3:17 AM.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">On the display, an unfamiliar number. Uncertain, but curious, she answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">There was no voice on the other end. Just slow, almost unnatural breathing, filling the earpiece as if someone were too close to the microphone.</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"Hello?" Tallin said, her voice faint.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Silence. Then, a cold whisper:</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"Don't look out the window."</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">A shiver ran down her spine. Despite the warning, her eyes moved on their own. She looked.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The curtains were slightly open, and between the cracks was something. A tall, motionless figure seemed to be staring at her. She couldn't make out a face, but she felt that gaze upon her.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">She yanked the curtains shut and curled up under the covers, her heart racing. The phone hadn't stopped transmitting that breathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Then the voice came back, closer, more cruel:</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"You looked."</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The line went dead.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">The next morning, she checked her call log: no incoming numbers, no trace of the call.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">From that night on, every day at 3:17 a.m., her phone vibrated. And the same message always appeared on the screen:</span><br /><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"I'm still at your window."</span></p>
