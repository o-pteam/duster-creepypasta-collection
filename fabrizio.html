<h1><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">"Massacre Island" &ndash; The Story Within the Story</span></h1>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Fabrizio was twenty years old and lived alone in a small apartment on the outskirts of the city. He didn't have many friends, but he didn't care: he preferred spending his nights on the computer, writing his horror story on Wattpad.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">He called it "Massacre Island." It was his obsession. Every night he added new details, new deaths, new dark presences. The more he wrote, the more he felt something watching him. But he thought it was just a hunch. When you live alone, even silence seems like noise.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">That night, however, something was different.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">He closed his laptop at 3:17 AM. He rubbed his eyes, huffed, and threw himself onto the bed, exhausted. He fell asleep almost immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">But he wasn't dreaming.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">---</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">He woke up. Or at least, that's what it seemed like. He couldn't move. He was lying on the bed, his eyes wide, his body rigid. He tried to scream, but his mouth was sealed by an invisible silence. Sleep paralysis, he thought&hellip; He'd heard about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Then he felt the wind.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">A cold breath caressed the back of his neck, as if someone were breathing right behind him.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">But the window was closed. The door was closed. There was no way to let air in.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">And yet the wind grew stronger. Until it became a hiss. A deep breath. Uneven.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">He wasn't alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Slowly, with the extreme effort of someone imprisoned in his own body, he barely managed to move his eyes&hellip; and he saw it.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Behind him, standing on the bed, was a being.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">It was tall. Too tall to be human. Its neck was long, twisted like a broken branch. It slid down toward him like a snake hanging from the ceiling. Its mouth was wide open, motionless, as if screaming but making no sound. Its eyes were empty sockets, but they were weeping blood. Not just one or two trickles: it was a constant flow, as if the creature were emptying its soul through its eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">And it was staring at him. From above, its neck bent at an unnatural angle.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">It wasn't moving. It wasn't breathing. But it was there.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Fabrizio felt his heart pounding in his chest. He wanted to wake up. He wanted to scream. But it was as if the monster itself were part of the dream... or reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="background-color: #000000; color: #ffffff;">Then, finally, he managed to close his eyes for a second. When he opened them again... it was gone.</span></p>
